Rules of LCR!
The object of the game is to be the last player with chips.
You can have as many players as you'd like, but three is the minimum.
Each player begins with three chips.
When it is your turn, you roll one die for each coin you have. The maximum is three.
If you roll:
1 = L -> Pass a chip to the left
2 = R -> Pass a chip to the right
3 = C -> Pass a chip to the center pot. These are now out of play.
Any other amount rolled is a skipped turn where no chips are moved.

Good luck!
